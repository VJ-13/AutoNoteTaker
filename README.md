AutoNoteTaker is a speech to text program that transcribes ALL your lectures (and any other videos) for you automatically! 
This program was developed for the AssemblyAI challenge at MacHacks 2, and our main inspiration behind it as online students was to create something that could help make the lives of all students easier, and facilitate their learning.

So how does it work? You put in an mp4/mp3 file of your lecture, specify where you want your notes to go, and it returns a fully complete Word document there with everything you need. More specifically, this program uploads the file to AssemblyAI, a powerful speech transcription API that uses natural language processing (NLP) to figure out what is being said in the recording, and the key points and moments.
